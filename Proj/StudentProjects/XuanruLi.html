<li><p>my dataset is dataset of all the US stock within 5 years but it’s a little big. I make three subset which including three stocks in the stock market, which are AAL, Facebook and Apple. In this project I mainly focs on visualization of stock price and make prediction by using MachineLearning.</p></li>
<li><p>There are four parts of this project, first two parts are prediction using linear regression and polynomial regression. Last two parts are visualization by using Plotly and Altair in terms of history stock price of AAL and comparisons between Apple and Facebook</p></li>

<p>Firstly, read the dataset and clean the data,becasue the dataset is too large and altair only shows max row of 5000, here I choose one stock(AAL) sample from original dataset</p>

<li><p>here we also keep just 3th to 6th digit position and we can see that after 4th degree, the error goes up a little bit, I assume that 4th degree is relatively perefect but since the overall error is small so I’m not going to add degree and count error here</p></li>
<li><p>Overall the relationship between overfitting and underfitting is now obvious here because the low difference of values, but the structure of prediction is ok and it can be effectively used in other datasets.</p></li>

<p>We can see here at the 2013, Facebook actually had lower price than apple, but after 2016, Facebook suppressed Apple in terms of price and hold the lead for most of following lwing time</p>
<p>However, we cannot say Facebook has larger scale or larger profitability than Apple, because I think the reason why Apple cannot beat Facebook in terms of stock price is because Apple, as a giant company, has more stock shares so it makes the individual stock share price not too high</p>

<p>In this project I try to used what I learned in math10 about Pandas to find sub dataset and re-incorporate dataset, and use Machinelearning to predict the close price by (open,high low) price and polynomial open price and also compute the error. Also I use the Altair bursh and transform to plot a flexible graph so that I can see the detailed close price for a certain period. Last, I use Plotly as extra topic to plot the history AAL price and compare two famous companies : Apple and Facebook</p>
