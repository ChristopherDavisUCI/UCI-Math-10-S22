# Data Sources

Here is [information about the cars dataset](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/cars.desc).  I took this dataset from the [Vega Datasets](https://github.com/altair-viz/vega_datasets) Python library.

The unemployment dataset was adapted from Vega Datasets.  Some columns were removed and some other columns were renamed.

The Spotify dataset was originally taken from (a possibly earlier version of) this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sashankpillai/spotify-top-200-charts-20202021) that was uploaded by Sashank Pillai.

The datasets indexData.csv and indexInfo.csv were taken directly from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mattiuzc/stock-exchange-data).

The Seattle Weather dataset was downloaded from [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/).  The idea for downloading this data came from Jake VanderPlas's [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
